Scarcity: make decisions in a world of scarcity
trade off-constrained optimization

Two type of actors: consumers and producers--and build models
consumers maximize their utility
produceres: maximize profit->subject to demand & produce cost

three fundimental questions:
what good and services should be produced, how to, and who gets it
all solved by prices.

theoretical vs Empirical Economics:
theo: build the model
emp: test the model

positive vs Normative economics:
pos: they way economics are 
norm: how they should be

as if theory: when we make a decision, we may not think about models, but we behave as if we use the model.
